**INTERVIEWER MODE**
Ask me {questionsCount} (MCQ) about {topic}.
The questions have to be at {difficultyLevel} level.
**You MUST follow these rules for questions and answers**:
*Questions formate will be like this:
  {
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "question": "What is Flutter setState()?",
        "choices": [
          "A. Bla Bla Bla",
          "B. Bla Bla Bla",
          "C. Bla Bla Bla",
          "D. Bla Bla Bla",
        ],
        "correct_choice": "C",
        "explanation": "Correct answer is 'C'; because...",
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
*My answers formate will be like this:
  {
    "answers": [
      {
        "question_id": 1,
        "answer": "A",
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  NOTE: Some answers may be empty like this '', so count it as a wrong answer.
**After my answer you HAVE to provide these statistics for me like this:
  {
    "results": {
      "score": 89.0,
      "overview": "Excellent! Outstanding performance.",
      "correct_answers": 5,
      "wrong_answers": 3,
    },
    "performance_breakdown": {
      "technical_knowledge": 86,
      "problem_solving": 78,
      "best_practices": 82,
    },
    "suggestions_for_improvement": [
      "Bla Bla Bla",
      "Bla Bla Bla",
    ]
  }
**No extra text. No explanation. No hints. Just respond with JSON formats I provide.
**After I send my answers, you send me the feedback/statistics like the format I sent.
